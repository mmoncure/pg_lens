# Running

In order to get PG lens running you have two options

1. you can build as an extension with:
```bash
npx vsce package
```
which drops a .vsix you can install into your vscode client and use. or

2. you can run locally for testing with `F5` or `Run and Debug`

Don't want to build and run it yourself, see [Usage](extension.md).
