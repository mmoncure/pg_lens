# PG Lens

An unpolished and unfinished pgsql LSP built with Treesitter and pgsql grammar forked from @DerekStride. You can find and contribute to that [here](https://github.com/maximjov/tree-sitter-sql).

## Why?

because @mmoncure wanted me to; some fancy mission statement probably belongs around here.
